## What I Built

These were my first side projects during high school. I learned programming through books and searching the web, just for fun and to show my friends and family.

**Sounds Through History** was my oldest project, an educational soundboard app with iconic historical sounds. I built it with Android Studio and Java, which taught me the basics of mobile development.

**Speed Ball** was a minimalist 3D endless runner that got over 500 downloads. Simple design with smooth gameplay mechanics.

**Forest Bounce** was my first "real" project where I designed everything from scratch. I figured out physics, enemy spawning, music, tap controls, and UI all on my own. It's a retro mobile game with clean graphics that I published to Google Play and Apple App Store. I added ads, music, and optimized keywords to get more downloads.

## Tech Stack

- **Android Studio & Java** for Sounds Through History
- **Unity Engine & C#** for Speed Ball and Forest Bounce

## What I Learned

These taught me the whole process of making apps from start to finish. I learned how to handle user feedback, fix bugs, and actually ship something people could download and use.

## Impact

These apps are pretty old now, but I'm still proud I published each one. Honestly, publishing an app at that age felt impossible, but I learned that things always feel impossible until they're done. That's something I still think about whenever I'm building anything new.
