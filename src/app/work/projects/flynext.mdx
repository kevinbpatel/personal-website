## What I Built

FlyNext is a travel booking platform I built for my final CSC309 project at UofT. Users can search flights and hotels in real-time, make bookings, and manage their trips. Hotel owners get a dashboard to track bookings and revenue.

Our team started with 3 people but one dropped the course halfway through. Despite this, we finished in the top 4 out of 150+ groups and got 108% on the project.

## Features

The app handles the full booking flow - search, book, pay, and manage cancellations. I integrated external APIs for live flight/hotel data with autocomplete search. Users get PDF invoices and email confirmations. The hotel dashboard shows analytics and lets owners manage inventory.

I added JWT authentication, dark/light mode toggle, and made it fully responsive. The booking system supports partial cancellations and refunds.

## Tech Stack

Built with Next.js and TypeScript on the frontend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Docker for deployment. Used external APIs for flight/hotel data and implemented RESTful endpoints for all the booking logic.

## What I Learned

This was my first full-stack project, so I had to learn everything from database design to API integration pretty quickly. I used ChatGPT and Claude to help debug issues and understand new concepts, which sped up development a lot.

Managing Git workflow with a smaller team taught me about project scope and prioritizing features. The tight deadline meant I had to pick up new frameworks fast while keeping the code maintainable.

## Results

Getting top 4 recognition was unexpected, especially after losing a team member. The project proved I could build something substantial from scratch and adapt when things don't go as planned.
